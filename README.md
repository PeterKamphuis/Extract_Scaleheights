# Extract_Scaleheights
A collection of python scripts to extract the scale height from HI data cubes. The form the basis of the analysis in Saponara+ 2021 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...652A.108S/abstract)
And are based on the method of Olling+ 1995-1996 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996AJ....112..457O/abstract). Probably easier to understand from chapter 5 O'Brien's thesis (https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/150969).
